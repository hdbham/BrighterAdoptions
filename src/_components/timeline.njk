<p> Counseling and Information: Birth mothers are provided with counseling services and detailed information about the adoption process, their rights, and available options. They can discuss their feelings, concerns, and preferences with counselors.</ p>
  
<p>Creating an Adoption Plan: Birth mothers work with adoption professionals to create a personalized adoption plan. This plan includes preferences for the adoptive family, level of openness in the adoption, and the type of contact desired after the adoption.</p p>
  
<p>Choosing Adoptive Parents: Birth mothers often have the opportunity to review profiles of prospective adoptive parents. They can select a family they feel comfortable with and believe will provide a loving home for their child.</p p>

<p>Legal Process: Once the birth mother chooses the adoptive family, legal procedures begin. The birth mother's rights are carefully explained, and she may sign legal documents to proceed with the adoption.</p p>

<p>Post-Placement Support: After the placement, birth mothers often receive ongoing emotional support. Some may also choose to have contact with the adoptive family and the child through letters, photos, or visits, depending on the agreed-upon terms.</p p>
