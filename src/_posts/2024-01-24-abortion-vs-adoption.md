With family planning options such as abortion being off the table and/or severely restricted for many in states -- such as Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin, Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina -- You might be asking, what can you do if you don't want to raise a child? What is a girl to do?\
\
I wouldn't blame you for thinking "Maybe I can be sneaky and terminate my pregnancy without law enforcement knowing", but is it worth it to break the law in these very restrictive states? What could that mean? Dangerous procedures? Capital punishment? \
\
No matter what state you are in, the option of adoption is available to you.\
\
