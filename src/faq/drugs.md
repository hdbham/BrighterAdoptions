title: My Baby Has Been Exposed to Drugs or Alcohol and Won't Be Adopted
---

There are a lot of birth moms who have not been able to remain clean during their pregnancy. Addiction is a disease and there will not be any judgment passed because your unborn child has been exposed. There will be no referral made to authorities or welfare services. If you are making an adoption plan, there is no reason to file a report.

We have a large percentage of moms taking Methadone, Suboxone, and Subutex. We have moms out here who go to the clinic for their meds and attend NA meetings for support. We have moms on probation, parole, and some who are currently incarcerated. None of these things will be a reason that you arenâ€™t provided adoption services. We have families open and willing to take babies who have been exposed in utero. We always have families willing and able to adopt these babies.
