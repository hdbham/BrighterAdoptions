title: No Privacy
---

Your privacy is one of our top priorities. We will do all in our power and within the scope of the law to protect your privacy. When you relinquish your rights to a child, besides the agency you are working with, and the medical facilities providing care, the only other departments that will know your identity are the Department of Vital Records in the state you deliver in and the Court of Law that the adoption is finalized in. There are very strict privacy laws in place for your protection. Once an adoption is finalized, the records are sealed. If you want a completely closed adoption, we will protect your identity.
