title: I Am Not Your Typical Birth Mom
---

I wish I knew what a typical birth mother was….

No two people are exactly the same. It would be irresponsible of us to think that all birth moms are the same and all placing their babies for the same reason. This is just not true!

I have worked with birth moms who have been as young as thirteen and as old as forty-five. I have provided services to college grads with exceptionally high IQs and I have worked with moms that were mentally disabled and just about everything in between. Every person has different needs and requires different services.

I have provided adoption services to moms who were victims of a sexual assault that resulted in a pregnancy. I have worked with moms who were married and had other children and didn’t feel they could provide for one more child.

There is no one size fits all mentality at this agency. Have you ever felt like a square peg trying to fit into a round hole? Hopefully you never feel that way with us. I like to borrow Burger King’s slogan and tell you that you can have it your way at this agency!

We work with every race and ethnicity, every socioeconomic class, every age and ability.

There are many different attitudes and thoughts about adoption and the reasons for placing a baby vary just as greatly as personalities do.
