title: It Will Be Easier if I just Give My Baby to...
---

In some cases, I can see why it would be easier to leave your baby with your mom, or your friend, while you get on your feet. As long as you know that the people you are leaving the child with have the resources and stability to care for your child like he or she is their own… I get it. But let’s be honest, is that what they want?

Brighter Adoptions has families who have been waiting years to have a child of their own, and:

- have saved thousands of dollars to adopt.
- have passed background clearances and physicals.
- have been screened to ensure that they have the temperament, intelligence, and physical stamina to parent a child.
- have been interviewed by Mental Health Professionals to verify their emotional fitness.
- have undergone intrusive investigation into their finances.
- have verified with multiple people that they are indeed people of high moral character.

We do not place babies with just anyone.

Applicants are put through a battery of screenings just to become approved to be adoptive parents.

Has the person you are considering leaving your child with been adequately investigated and trained?

You may think it’s easier to let your relative or friend care for your baby, but what happens when things don’t work out? You are ultimately responsible for the welfare of your child. If you want to let someone else care for that child, please do the greater service to your child and consent to their adoption so they can be placed into a forever family who wants nothing more than to be their parent.
