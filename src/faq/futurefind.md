title: My Child Will Find Me in the Future and I Do Not Want That
---

If you wish to have a completely closed adoption, your name will NOT be shared with the adoptive family. If the adoptive family doesnâ€™t know your name, it would be very difficult to track a person down. There are legislators pushing to make a law that allows adoptees the right to access their original birth certificate when they reach adulthood. The laws are different in all states. If this is something that you are concerned about, call me and we can figure out what the laws are in the state you reside, or in the state you will give birth.

This is a normal fear and one that I think may be alleviated by talking to adult adoptees. Many birth moms feel like the grown adult child will be upset with them when or if they find them. This is just not the norm. Most adoptees are curious about their biological family and want to have a relationship during adulthood. Adoptees are normally just looking so they can tell you THANK YOU for making the choice that you did.
