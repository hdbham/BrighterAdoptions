title: I think the Adoptive Parents Are Just Adopting for the Check
---

It is not uncommon to hear this sentence from potential birth mothers. It is a common misconception to think that adoption is like foster care. IT IS NOT! There is no money, or grants, or funding for adoptive parents. An adoptive parent is considered no different than a biological parent. Once you relinquish your rights, full care, custody, and control is given to the agency. We pass that on to the adoptive parents and we monitor the placement for six months to ensure bonding and proper development. Once the six months is up and we are satisfied that the best interests of the child are being served, we consent to the adoption during an open court hearing. At that time, the Judge says, “This child will now and forever be considered no different than if he or she had been born to the petitioners.” The agency is no longer involved and the adoptive parents are the child’s forever parents.

Nobody gets a check for being a parent. These parents are adopting because they want a child. It costs a lot of money to adopt. There are no financial benefits.
