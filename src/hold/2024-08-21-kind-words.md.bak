Dear Sandi, 

Where do I start?  You're amazing! What you do for moms and families is absolutely incredible! When I started my adoption journey I thought I would never find the perfect person to go through this tough time with, and then I found you. When I think about you so many words come to mind... incredible, selfless, patient, kind, loving, determined, genuine, perfect and sooo many more. I chose you because from the moment I spoke to you, it felt like I had known you for forever and I knew that I could trust you during this very sad, but also very very happy time in my life. You flew me and my family out to Utah and made sure we had every single thing we could possible need. You made yourself available in every way and I am so grateful to you for everything you've done for me and my family. 

Growing up the way I did and not having a real family is the reason I why I want my children to have the best life I could possibly give them even if that means being raised by someone other than me. You are doing wonderful things for mothers and couples who long for a child. You should be so proud of yourself and your team for things you do! I will forever recommend you to any birth mom and any couple looking into adoption. You have become like a mom to me and I am so incredibly thankful for you being in my life. 

I am writing this letter to you because you have become a big part of me and I want you to know how much you mean to me. I want you to know the impact you've made on my life is absolutely amazing and wonderful and I wouldn't give it up for the world. I love you to the moon and back and I hope you never stop being the miracle in so many people lives. You are a miracle! You are beautiful! You are amazing! You are the glue that has held me together so many times and I will forever owe you my life! Sandi Quick, you are a wonderful miracle to the world! Please never ever ever doubt your worth! I would give anysthing to make sure you continue doing what you are doing for people. 

Lastly, Thank you! thank you for giving me confidence! Thank you for finding my babies amazing families! Thank you for always being there for me! Thank you for caring! Thank you for being you! Thank you for every single single thing you have done for me and all these other families out there! Thank you for everything you have done and continue to do daily! Thank you! I love you! I will miss you! I am so blessed to know you! 

Love one of your moms, Alyssa Nicole <3 2024
