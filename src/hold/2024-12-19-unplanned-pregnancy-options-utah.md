# Unplanned Pregnancy Options in Utah: A Complete Guide for Expectant Mothers

Finding out you're pregnant when you weren't expecting it can be overwhelming, especially in Utah. You might feel scared, confused, or unsure about what to do next. The good news is that you have options, and you don't have to face this alone.

## Understanding Your Options

When you're dealing with an unplanned pregnancy in Utah, you have three main options to consider:
seo### 1. Parenting
Choosing to parent your child is a valid and loving choice. Many women who initially feel overwhelmed find that with the right support, they can successfully parent their child. Utah offers various resources for single mothers and families in need.

**Support Available:**
- Medical assistance programs
- Housing support
- Food assistance (SNAP)
- Childcare assistance
- Educational opportunities

### 2. Adoption
Adoption is a loving choice that gives your child the opportunity to grow up in a stable, loving family while allowing you to pursue your goals and dreams. In Utah, you have complete control over the adoption process.

**What You Need to Know:**
- You choose the adoptive family
- You can have an open, semi-open, or closed adoption
- You receive free medical care and support
- You can change your mind until the adoption is finalized
- All adoption services are free to birth mothers

### 3. Abortion
Abortion is legal in Utah but has restrictions. It's important to understand the laws and requirements before making this decision.

## Why Consider Adoption in Utah?

Utah has some of the best adoption laws in the country, designed to protect birth mothers and ensure they have the support they need throughout their pregnancy and beyond.

**Benefits of Choosing Adoption:**
- **Complete Control**: You choose the adoptive family and type of adoption
